Message from Vikas Yadav: Founder of Zense

Hi folks,

Very happy to see this hackathon happening again. While on campus I loved being part of events like these. A lot of my interests developed as side effects of these events. With that in mind and to encourage the spirit of innovation - I would like to announce a bonus prize of Rs 5000 from my side for the idea which I find the best. In case it's difficult to decide a single winner - please don't mind if I split the prize into two.

Parameters I am going to judge you on:
- Feasibility of the idea
- Completeness of the implementation
- Effort you put in
- Impact of the idea

Some potential ideas you can think of:
- Automate a mundane task which you might have to everyday using python
- Explore the python ecosystem to find some amazing libraries - use it to solve a real-world problem around you
- Or just make something cool


And it's not just about the award, if you are interested after the hackathon to pursue your idea further I would be happy to mentor.

Regards,
Vikas
